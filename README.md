# Inventory Management Python

# Simple Inventory Management System (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a basic inventory management system for supply chain operations. It was built using only Python fundamentals (lists, dictionaries, functions) inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
-  View current inventory (products, stock, price, reorder level).
-  Add new products to the inventory.
-  Update stock levels (e.g., sales or restocking).
-  Check which products are below their reorder level.

## Tech Used
- Python (core data structures: lists & dictionaries).
- Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda).


## Why I Built This
I wanted to practice Python basics while connecting it to supply chain concepts.  
This project shows how simple code can track stock, simulate sales, and prevent stockouts.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the `.ipynb` notebook.
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda or JupyterLab).
3. Run the cells in order to test inventory management functions.
